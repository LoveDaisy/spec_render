# Spectral Renderer

This is a personal project trying to solve this question:
What is the exact color (RGB) when given a spectrum? As we know, a spectrum
is the only way to describ a color without any ambiguity. Given a spectrum
we can see and repreduce a color exactly the same, theoretically.

I have write a series blogs explaining the outline and details of the whole thing. You can
